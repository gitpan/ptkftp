0.51  Sat Aug 17, 2002
	- Added "require" for my "SetPalette.pl" file.  Makes foreground white when 
	  background palette (-c="color") is set really dark.
0.52  -Not released-
0.53  Added checkbox to save password.  Password is encrypted before being 
	  saved to a text file called ".ptkftp.users", and is associated with a 
	  server and user-name.  This option is only available if the following 
	  modules are installed:  "Crypt::CBC", and either "Crypt::DES" or 
	  "Crypt::Blowfish_PP".
	- Added "-w" (width) option to specify fixed character width for the 
	  text and listboxes.
	- Now saves last user-name and directory under which a given host was 
	  logged in to.

	- Remembered passwords now change when user is changed in dropdown list.
	- Fixed bug where some passwords were not stored.
	- Last directory accessed now saved with user instead of host (remembers 
	  which directory each user was last in on a given host.
0.55  -Not released-
0.56  -Not released-
0.57	 Sat Aug 24, 2002
	- Added "Edit, View, and Diff" options.  Selected remote file is auto-
	  matically downloaded to a temp file, and viewed, edited, or compared 
	  there.  If editing, it is automatically uploaded back when done.
	- Added Server-pinging option to keep connection open while idle.  Server 
	  is "ping"ed after 2 minutes, then at random intervals between 1 and 3 
	  minutes thereafter.  Pinging occurrs automatically if a "remote" file 
	  is opened for editing.
	- Added "file rename" option and dialog.
	- Added user-specified encryption module (-crypt=...) option.  Previously, 
	  "DES" was tried, then failing that, "Blowfish_PP".  The specified option 
	  is saved on exit.  Encryption is only used to encrypt "remembered" 
	  passwords when storing them to the ".ptkftp.users" file to prevent them 
	  from being viewable by anyone.  No encryption is necessary nor any 
	  encryption module needed to run the program if one does not wish the 
	  program to "remember" passwords.
0.59	 Sat Aug 31, 2002
	- Removed "keepopen" feature if running under Windows.
	- Added wheel-mouse support to scrollbars.
0.60	 Thu Feb 20, 2003
	- Fixed bug that messed up host-name in dropdown after disconnect and 
	  attempting to reconnect.
0.61  Unknown
	- Fixed bug where 2 sets of "." and ".." appeared in right-hand file list.
0.62  Thu June 2, 2005
	- Changed width to maxwidth in argument list for JBrowseEntry.
	- Improved selected directory history list and limited it to default of
	  last 20 directories selected.  Overrideable with "-h #".
0.80	- Completely redid to use Net::xFTP for all connections.  Also changed 
	  the file listings to use Tk::MListbox instead of Tk::Listbox so that 
	  file owner, group, permissions, and size could be displayed in 
	  columns along with the name.  One can also now see which files are 
	  directories.  Ascii/Binary radio buttons now greyed out except when 
	  using Net::FTP.
0.84 - Fixed some minor bugs.
0.86 - Fixed file listing bug in Windows - was trying to use "ls" command, 
	  which doesn't exist in Windows, now emulates "ls -l" without user/
	  group data.
0.90 - Fixed SFTP "input must be 8 bytes long at /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.7/Crypt/DES.pm"
	  bug (actually didn't "fix", just worked around) by wrapping calls to 
	  sftp->new, sftp->put, and sftp->chmod along with their arguments in 
	  an eval string and evalling them?!?!?!  Must be something to do with 
	  Tk's en/decoding.  Placing the variable arguments as constants (in 
	  the eval string), seems to work.  Other functions don't seem to have 
	  problems.  Only had this happen on servers for one client.
0.91	- Fixed "Show All" - was broke somewhere in recent versions.
0.92	- Modified "Connect" button to say "connecting" and be disabled while 
	  connecting to a remote host.
1.00	- Added support for Net::SSH2 for doing Secure FTP (in addition to 
	  existing Net::SFTP support - by updating Net::xFTP to v. 0.20)
	  Created Windows binary and self-extracting setup exe.  Made compatable 
	  with Windows.
